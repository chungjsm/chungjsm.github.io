title: Chaebol or Bust -- But At What Cost?
---

Competition in Korea is at a fever pitch. Students, lured by the prospect of a better future, spend years on end studying in cram schools in a bid to gain admission to the nation’s top universities. However, as these very students move onto college, more and more are finding that the competition is just as fierce, if not more so, in their exit than their entrance — in other words, recent college graduates are having difficulty landing jobs these days.

According to Statistics Korea, the number of college graduates without jobs in 2013 was 3.08 million, up 3.2% from the previous year. Additionally, the unemployment rate of those aged 15 to 29 was double the national average, and their labor force participation rate was 60.1% — lower than the 61.9% held at the start of the 2008 financial crisis.

At the root of this problem seems to be a “bubble” in college education. While only about 30% of Koreans went to college in the early 90’s, the number quickly rose to 80% by 2004. This, in part, can be attributed to the nation’s Confucian influence and post-war experience, which led many to see education as both a path of virtue and ticket out of poverty. Consequently, heightened expectations and societal pressures have increased the number of universities and students alike, pushing Korea’s college attendance rate to the top amongst all OECD countries; but the question is:  has it gone up too much?

According to Korea’s Ministry of Employment and Labor, there were approximately 300,000 college graduates in 2012, with the number expected to exceed 500,000 by 2015. At the same time, the ratio of highly educated people among the unemployed is rising – from 11% in 2000 to 15% in 2005 and 19% in 2013 – suggesting that there are indeed too many college graduates.

However, this issue is not one of numbers alone; while there were approximately 20,400 total openings at the 194 largest corporations in 2011, there were 250,000 jobs at small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) that went unfilled. Evidently, many students are holding out to try and enter the chaebol and other large Korean corporations. In fact, over the past few years, it has become normal for college seniors to delay graduation by a year or two to add to their qualifications (or “specs,” as commonly referred to in Korea). Many study English or Chinese to better equip themselves for a global economy; some study for professional certifications to prove their intellectual rigor; and others receive coaching for resumes and interviews – all with one goal in mind:  to enter a large corporation.

It should be noted that this newfound predilection towards the chaebol marks a shift from the past, when students – particularly from top universities – pursued careers in banking, law, and civil service instead. Now, according to JobKorea, Kia Motors and Hyundai Motors are the third and eighth most desirable places to work, respectively; whereas a decade ago, Hyundai was 21st on the same list and Kia was not even considered. One reason why the chaebol are attracting so many students is the strength of their global brands. Already lured by the higher salaries, perks, and social status, students have a growing sense that working for a large Korean firm is valuable, not just for themselves, but for the nation at large as well. And conversely, students admit that they would be ashamed to work at an SME, and would rather be unemployed than accept a position with less status and upward mobility.

Thus, while a select few enjoy the rewards of their hard work, others, less fortunate, continue to abstain from the job market – and with dire consequences. In Korea, it is an unspoken financial rule to have enough savings for a home before getting married. However, given the slow economy, many Koreans are finding themselves forced to give up their middle class dreams of settling down and having kids. Some, disappointed with their future prospects, are choosing to splurge on themselves now in lieu of saving for retirement. This is of particular concern, as an aging demographic, bundled with higher student loans and delayed entrances into corporate life, will begin to put an incredible amount of pressure on pensions, savings, and retirement funds. Similar to the US, the onus of supporting the elderly will soon fall upon the younger generation, and the already present consequences – fewer marriages and births – forebode a vicious cycle ahead.
