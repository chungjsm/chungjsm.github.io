Jungian analysis


There’s been a lot of commotion lately over the existential threat of AI, largely in part due to Elon Musk, who has stirred up debate by continually going on record to say that AI is the “biggest risk we face as a civilization”. Musk has, in particular, expressed concern over the concentration of AI power at the current tech giants, including Google and Facebook, that are clearly leading the pack in terms of both the amounts of data they store and the quality of AI talent they hire.

Indeed, the debate over the safety of AI is a hot one and there are strong arguments for both sides. But regardless of which side they toe the line from, most AI experts can agree on one thing - that AI will be the harbinger of a global shift in the job market. In fact, several thought leaders - economists, computer scientists, historians alike - have predicted AI to bring on an economic revolution akin to the Industrial Revolution, where the advent of manufacturing greatly improved the standard of living but cost countless workers their then-deemed-obsolete jobs in the process.
